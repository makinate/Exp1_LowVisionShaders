## Basic Unity and Gitignore instructions
Make sure that .gitignore file and Unity settings are correct and not overwritten.

In order to make sure the SpatialMapping heirarchy and settings are
constant across all versions for all users, the following changes were
made to the project settings - under Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor
- the Version Control mode setting was changed to support "Visible Meta
Files" and the Asset Serialization mode setting was changed to "Force
Text"
